# BlendPet

![Demo 1](assets/demos/Demo%201.gif)

A completely useless (but kinda adorable) little pet that lives in your Blender animation editors.  
BlendPet adds a pixel-art cat — and maybe more pets later — that wanders around, sleeps, stretches, and generally distracts you while you’re trying to animate.

## Features
- **Animated pet** – A pixel cat with animations for walking, running, idling, licking, cleaning, playing, pouncing, stretching, and sleeping.
- **Animation Editor Overlay** – Lives in your Timeline, Dope Sheet, and Graph Editor.
- **Customizable** – Change its size to fit your workflow.
- **Non-intrusive** – It just hangs out. It won’t mess with your scene (just your focus 😉).

## Installation
1. Download the latest release `.zip`.
2. Open Blender.
3. Go to `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons`.
4. Click **Install…** and select the zip file.
5. Enable **BlendPet** using the checkbox.

## Usage
- **Toggle** – Turn the pet on/off from the Viewport Header.
- **Settings** – Adjust size of the pet in the Add-on Preferences.

## Contributing 

**Want to add to the project?**

I’m not amazing at coding 😅  
The addon works, but there’s definitely room to clean things up, optimize stuff, or just do things in a smarter way. If you know Python and bpy feel free to help improve it/add features.

- **Found a bug?** Open an issue and tell me what broke.
- **Want to improve the code?** Fork the repo. Most of the logic is in `pet_engine.py` and `renderer.py`.
- **New feature idea?** Go for it. Code away and submit a PR.
- **Sprites?** If you’re a pixel artist and want to improve the cat (look in `textures/`) or add a dog 👀, open an issue or reach out.
